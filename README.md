# CRA-ARCGIS
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This repository is a samble demonstration of how we integrate [@arcgis/webpack-plugin](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-webpack-plugin).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

### `yarn run test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
