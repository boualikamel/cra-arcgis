# CRA-ARCGIS
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This repository is a samble demonstration of how we integrate [@arcgis/webpack-plugin](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-webpack-plugin) using [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) fot adding new [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) extensions without ejecting a react webpack config.
